# Employee Badge System - Airtable Implementation Complete

## Session Summary

This document captures the complete implementation of the Employee Badge System backend using Airtable. The system successfully creates a gamification platform for bakery operations with automated badge assignment, points tracking, and rewards management.

## System Architecture Overview

The badge system consists of 5 interconnected Airtable tables:
- **App_Employees**: Enhanced employee records with badge/points tracking
- **App_Badges**: Master catalog of all available badges
- **App_Employee_Badges**: Junction table tracking badge assignments
- **App_Rewards_Store**: Catalog of purchasable rewards
- **App_Points_Redemptions**: History of point redemptions

## Automations Implemented

### 1. New Employee Badge Assignment
**Trigger**: New record created in App_Employees table
**Action**: Create record in App_Employee_Badges table

```javascript
// Trigger: When record created in App_Employees
// Action: Create Employee_Badges record

let newEmployee = input.config();
let badgeId = "recFVGl26SqsjcrhB"; // New Joiner badge record ID

await base("App_Employee_Badges").createAsync({
  "Employee_ID": newEmployee.employeeId,
  "Employees": [{id: newEmployee.recordId}],
  "Badge_ID": [{id: badgeId}],
  "Date_Earned": new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  "Is_Current": true,
  "Notes": "Auto-assigned on hire date"
});
```

### 2. Tenure Badge Assignment (Daily)
**Trigger**: Scheduled daily at 12:00 AM
**Action**: Create tenure badges for employees who don't have them

```javascript
let employeesTable = base.getTable("App_Employees");
let employeeBadgesTable = base.getTable("App_Employee_Badges");

console.log("Creating tenure badge automation...");

// Use the Tenure Badge record ID
let tenureBadgeRecordId = "recF70w2s55qLtOIQ";

let employeeQuery = await employeesTable.selectRecordsAsync({
    fields: ["Name", "Hire_Date", "Employee_ID"]
});

for (let employee of employeeQuery.records) {
    let name = employee.getCellValue("Name");
    let hireDate = employee.getCellValue("Hire_Date");
    let employeeId = employee.getCellValue("Employee_ID");
    
    console.log(`Processing: ${name}`);
    
    if (hireDate && employeeId) {
        // Check for existing tenure badges
        let existingBadges = await employeeBadgesTable.selectRecordsAsync({
            filterByFormula: `AND({Employee_ID} = "${employeeId}", {Badge_ID} = "Tenure Badge")`
        });
        
        if (existingBadges.records.length === 0) {
            try {
                let newRecord = await employeeBadgesTable.createRecordAsync({
                    "Employee_ID": employeeId,
                    "Employees": [{id: employee.id}],
                    "Badge_ID": [{id: tenureBadgeRecordId}],
                    "Date_Earned": hireDate,
                    "Is_Current": true,
                    "Notes": "Auto-assigned tenure badge"
                });
                console.log(`‚úÖ SUCCESS! Created tenure badge for ${name}`);
            } catch (error) {
                console.log(`‚ùå Error for ${name}:`, error.message);
            }
        } else {
            console.log(`${name} already has tenure badge`);
        }
    }
}

console.log("Tenure badge automation complete");
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Critical Format Requirements
1. **Linked Record Fields**: Must use array of objects format: `[{id: "recordId"}]`
2. **Multiple Record Links**: Always requires record IDs from the linked table
3. **Badge_ID Field**: Links to App_Badges table using record IDs (e.g., "recF70w2s55qLtOIQ")
4. **Employees Field**: Links to App_Employees table using record IDs (e.g., "recQapsuIfCxGs3Vp")

### Key Debugging Learnings
- Badge_ID field appears as `[object Object]` in console when it's a linked field
- Employee_ID field stores text values for identification
- Employees field creates the actual relationship for rollups
- Date format: Airtable accepts ISO format but displays in M/D/YYYY

### Points Economy Design
- **Entry Level Badges**: 5-10 points (New Joiner, Early Bird, Tenure)
- **Performance Badges**: 15-25 points (Team Player, Quality Focus, Star Performer, Customer Hero)
- **Leadership Badges**: 30+ points (Mentor, OG Member)
- **Low-Cost Rewards**: 15-30 points (Coffee, Pastry, Casual Pass)
- **Medium Rewards**: 75-100 points (Parking, Half Day Off)
- **High-Value Rewards**: 150-350 points (Gift Cards)

## Testing Results

### Successful Tests
‚úÖ **New Joiner Badge Automation**: Creates badge automatically when new employee is added  
‚úÖ **Tenure Badge Automation**: Creates badge for employees without duplicates  
‚úÖ **Points Rollup**: Total_Points_Earned correctly sums badge points  
‚úÖ **Badge Count**: Badge_Count accurately counts earned badges  
‚úÖ **Manual Badge Assignment**: Interface allows manual badge linking  
‚úÖ **Points Balance Calculation**: Current_Points_Balance = Earned - Spent  

### Current Status
- **Backend Complete**: All Airtable tables, relationships, and automations working
- **Test User**: Kodiak Smith (Employee_ID: 0618) with New Joiner + Tenure badges (15 points total)
- **Ready for**: Glide frontend implementation

## Files Created
- All badge definitions populated in App_Badges
- Sample rewards catalog in App_Rewards_Store  
- Working automations for new hire and tenure badges
- Test employee record with functioning badge assignments

## Security & Administration
- Badge awarding restricted to managers (to be implemented in Glide)
- Audit trail maintained in Created_Date and Notes fields
- Point balance verification prevents manipulation
- Approval workflow ready for high-value redemptions

*Implementation completed successfully. System ready for Glide frontend development.*
